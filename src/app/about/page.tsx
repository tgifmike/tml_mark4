					I was a passionate restaurant manager with over 20 years of experience
					in the culinary world. My journey began a server, then I worked my way
					up and though just about every job/position that exists in a
					restaurant. I quickly fell in love with the art of hospitality and the
					rhythm of service. Although I am no long in the trenchs, but i keep a
					toe dipped in doing software testing for Point of Sales Systems.

					served and every smile shared contributes to the unique tapestry of
					our culinary landscape.
